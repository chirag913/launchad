# Lays UI sound onto an ALREADY RENDERED mp4. Remotion never runs, no frame is
# redrawn: the video stream is copied byte for byte (-c:v copy), so neither
# tiled frames nor luminance jumps can come back and check-frames.mjs does not
# need re-running. One pass, about a second.

#   in   out/<id>.mp4          (silent, from render.sh)
#   out  out/<id>-sound.mp4    (next to it — the silent original stays)
#
# Beats live in scripts/beats/<id>.txt, not in this file. See that file for
# the format; you should never have to edit this script to score a new clip.
#
# THE PALETTE. Nine sounds. Each means exactly one thing, and it is chosen by
# the LEVEL OF MOTION (the DUR scale in src/motion.ts), never by which element
# it is attached to. Choose by element and the vocabulary grows without bound
# and the clip stops sounding like one thing:
#
#   key     a character was typed
#   click   the user pressed something          DUR.press
#   tick    a state flipped                     DUR.chip
#   pop     an element arrived                  DUR.panel
#   swipe   an element travelled                DUR.sheet
#   whoosh  THE SCREEN CHANGED — nothing else   phase change
#           (whoosh_soft is the same event, quieter — for a title handover)
#   impact  weight, a landing                   DUR.hero
#   riser   waiting, before an event
#   fold    everything collapses away
#
# The defect to avoid, because it has already been made once: putting `whoosh`
# on everything. A whoosh means the screen changed. Score an element arrival
# and a belt rotation with it too and the whole clip sounds identical.
